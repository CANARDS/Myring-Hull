# Myring-Hull
Myring Hull is an axisymmetric hull having the least drag coefficients, the profile of which can be calculated using Myring
Hull equations.
This Matlab code helps generate xy points for the profile of a Myring Hull, which can then be imported into a 3D CAD modeling
software -like Solidworks- to draw a 3D model of the specific Myring Axisymmetric Hull.
